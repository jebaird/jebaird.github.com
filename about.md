Hey there! My name is Jesse Baird. I was born and raised in Iowa. I'm currently living in Iowa City, IA with my daughter Julia, my wife Rachel and her son Carter. 

I love being in the great out doors, I'm fortunate enough to live next to a number parks that have great hiking / running trails. I love to run. I started about 10 years ago and I haven't stopped since. In the past couple of years I have ran a 3 1/2 marathons and a handful of shorter distance races.

### On This Blog

One of the coolest things about being a front end developer, is getting to work with all kinds of interfaces. Weather that be an interface for a new website, creating a new api / framework. I like dealing with abstractions, I think its more of the more interesting things about code on the front end. There are many ways to tackle a problem but on the front end there is always an opportunity to solve it differently than the last time you faced this issue.

I started blogging more as a personal reference than anything else. Its hard to measure how much you have learned over the past few years if you don't remember how you got there.
